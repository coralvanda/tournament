What is this?
-------------
This is a project created for the Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree program.  The tournament.sql file sets up a database modeling players and matches in a tournement, the tournament.py file allows for easy interaction with the database in set ways, and the tournament_test.py file is the instructor-provided code to test that things were set up and programmed correctly.

How to use
----------
The user must first run the tournament.sql file to set up the database and tables.  This can be done from the command line with "\ir tournament.sql" provided that the command is executed from the same directory as the file.  Then, also from the command line, use "python tournament_test.py" to run the test file.  Test results will be printed out to show what aspects of the program passed or failed.  The tournament.py file does not need to be run directly, but must be located in the same directory as the other files.
